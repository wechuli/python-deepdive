## Sequence Types

A type of data representation where elements are ordered and can be referenced by their position using an index.
There are six sequence types:strings, byte sequecnes, byte arrays, lists,tuples, range objects

## Iterable Type vs Sequence Type

What does it mean for an object to be iterable ?

It is a container type of object and we can list out the elements in that object one by one. So any sequence type is iterable. But an iterable is not necessarily a sequence type. Iterables are more general e.g sets or dicts.

## List Vs Tuples

- **Constant folding** - Constant folding is the process of recognizing and evaluating constant expression at compile time rather than computing them at runtime.
